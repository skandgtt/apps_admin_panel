groupby\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/groupby.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/groupby)\n\nSplit up JSON data into multiple files based on shared characteristics. Groupby is a command-line utility but can also be used from [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\n```shell\ngroupby staff.json 'staff/{department}.json'\n```\n\nIn the example above, the resulting output will one file for each department, \neach file containing an array of staff member objects for that department.\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\nnpm install groupby-cli -g\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nGroupby expects an input JSON file that contains an array of similarly-structured\nobjects, and will group those objects when they have matching values for whatever \nkeys you specify as placeholders in the output pattern.\n\nFor example, `staff/{department}.json` will group objects together into \nthe same file if their `department` key matches.\n\nGrouping on multiple keys is supported too: \n\n```shell\ngroupby staff.json 'staff/{department}/{country}/{role}.json'\n```\n\nThe only requirement for groups is that values can be turned into a string \n(and thus into a filename to which we can write the resulting JSON.) Values\nwill be [slugified](https://github.com/dodo/node-slug) for use in filenames\nbut will be left as-is in the JSON.\n\nIn some cases, your output pattern uniquely identifies each \nindividual object, e.g. \n\n```shell\ngroupby staff.json 'staff/{username}.json'\n```\n\nTo save just the objects without wrapping each of them in an array, use the \n`--unique` flag. In `--unique` mode, Groupby will throw an error if your \noutput pattern does unexpectedly lead to groups that contain more than one item.\n\n## Use from node.js\n\n```javascript\n// basic usage\nvar groupby = require('groupby-cli');\nvar groups = groupby.group(list, facets);\n\n// usage that is more advanced, and more \n// similar to the command-line\nvar keyPattern = 'staff/{departments}';\nvar staffByDepartment = groupby.group(staff, keyPattern);\nvar sales = staffByDepartment['staff/sales'];\n```\n\n`groupby.group` takes an options object as a third argument: \n\n* **underscore** to underscore the slugified keys\n    * `false` by default\n    * when using the command-line interface, this is always set to `true`\n* **catch**\n    * `false` (default) to throw an error when encountering an uncategorizable object (this happens when not all objects contain a value for the specified facets)\n    * `true`: don't throw such errors and just get rid of any uncategorizable objects\n    * `\"destination\"`: create a group with all uncategorizable objects at the specified key\n\n## License\n\nGroupby comes with a permissive [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license).\n\nThe `countries.json` dataset included among the examples comes with an \n[Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).\nFor the latest version, see @mledoze's [countries repository](https://github.com/mledoze/countries)\non GitHub.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"stdbrouw","email":"stijn@stdout.be"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-18T14:17:20.690Z","created":"2014-09-20T22:09:16.869Z","0.1.1":"2014-09-20T22:09:16.869Z","0.1.2":"2014-09-24T13:39:00.921Z","0.1.4":"2015-02-16T10:54:17.469Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-27T08:45:25.861Z","0.2.1":"2015-06-27T08:47:39.467Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/debrouwere/groupby","keywords":["json","transformation","data","etl"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/debrouwere/groupby.git"},"author":{"name":"Stijn Debrouwere","email":"stijn@debrouwere.org","url":"http://debrouwere.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/debrouwere/groupby/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
